// If n is the numerator and d the denominator of a fraction, that fraction is defined a (reduced) proper fraction if and only if GCD(n, d) = 1.

// For example 5/16 is a proper fraction, while 6/16 is not, as both 6 and 16 are divisible by 2, thus the fraction can be reduced to 3/8.

// Now, if you consider a given number d, how many proper fractions can be built using d as a denominator?

// For example, let's assume that d is 15: you can build a total of 8 different proper fractions between 0 and 1 with it: 1/15, 2/15, 4/15, 7/15, 8/15, 11/15, 13/15 and 14/15.

// You are to write a function that computes how many proper fractions you can build with a given denominator:

// 1 --> 0
// 2 --> 1
// 5 --> 4
// 15 --> 8
// 25 --> 20
// Be ready to handle big numbers.
